DATE = 20/5/2021


Admin:


done--1. Dashboard 
***- all projects and employees count and on click it should redirect to lsit of projects and employees added by admin


done--2. Projects
***- List of projects and there should tag of (active/deactive/deployed) + Start date + end date (only admin can see date)
***- Add projects -> project name -> selecte category (can add category from here or in different page) -> Description -> active/deactive/deployed -> save
***- All daily task -> is perfect, just set "apply filter" and "export" function just after "project" dropdown -> option for remove filter


done--3. Employees
***-> Add employees
***-> List of employees -> show employee id or serial number (it helps while we have same name/designation) -> show active/deactive tag -> can assign projects from here only with confirmation popup and also please show list of assigned projects only in view mode, not all projects. 
(no need to show email in list view -> Name,Mobile,Tag,Assign,active and assigned projects count,View)
***-> Update employee -> set edit button like submit -> when click on edit it will change name of submit. 
***--> Update employee -> for change password -> ask confirmation


DEVELOPER/EMPLOYEE :
	
	**While adding task if developer has added 8:30 hours already then it should ask for overtime hours to add. As right now I can add multiple time 8:30 hours which is not right. Once I added 8:30 hours, it will ask to add overtime hours and it will be highlight to both developer and admin in red mark. Like -> 8:30 hours [2 hours, in red tag/mark].

	***Option for remove filter after applying.

	***In project list, there will be tag of active/deployed [employee won't able to see deactive projects].

	***In task description -> I am adding content of 10 lines so it is not showing properly in list view so better to restrict after few words and in view detail -> show task list without scroll so user can easily view task.

1. in project list - only one status one can see, active means - project working, deactive means - project not in working, deployed means - on client server. So only one status at a time.
Ans: Changes Updated.

2. Please show project start month-year in list view in admin only. Like cvgig - May-2021
Ans: Changes Updated.


3. When I add projects - there should drop down for category. Category means, Mobile app, APIs, Dynamic web, Static web. So all these if we add once then admin can select from drop down and if admin wants to add new then also can add new.
Ans: Added.
 

4. If I want to add task list after 8:30 hours then it will ask is this overtime hours? If yes then it will add in task list but admin can see that extra time in over time field. Same in the employee side, they can see their daily time and overtime field. 
Ans: Added.


5. In employee, if I add task from dashboard then once it submit, it will redirect to task list so employees can see task directly. 
Ans: Changes Added.

6. employees - In task list - if I add something in search bar then it continuely showing error popup and search is not working
Ans: Error Solved.

7. In dashboard in both employee/admin - in chart view - in right corner which menu it showing?
Ans: https://prnt.sc/13fgj1y

8. In admin - what is the need of assigned project menu in admin ?
Ans: Admin can assign any project itself & can add their own task details [that can be anything] as like employee.
